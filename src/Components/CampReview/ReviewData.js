The atmosphere is very friendly and respectful, the pool area is really nice, there's a living room with a big tv and boardgames, a gym and much more. Breakfast is included and the buffet is great, lunch, snacks and dinner you can buy at the pool bar and just like everything else at this place, the food is great, really great! We came here to learn how to surf and it was so much fun. The instructors are so good and they really gave it all. Even though the waves at this beach are a bit tough, at the end of the week all of us was catching waves (not every wave of course, but some of them :) We had a blast! A big shoutout to Alex our instructor for being awesome!",
